# TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS PROJECT
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify tweets as positive or negative using text features. It's a binary classification task evaluated with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# INTRODUCTION
Twitter sentiment analysis has many applications across different sectors. For businesses, it can help track brand sentiment and customer satisfaction, providing valuable insights for marketing strategies and product development. For social scientists or political analysts, it can serve as a tool to monitor public opinion on current events, political candidates, or social issues. The primary focus of this project is on sentiment classification using a supervised machine learning approach, specifically logistic regression, which is simple, interpretable, and suitable for binary classification tasks. The project will preprocess the data, extract relevant features, and train a sentiment classifier to distinguish between positive and negative sentiments in Twitter data.

# PROBLEM FOUNDATION
The goal of this project is to address these challenges by building a machine learning model that can classify tweets into two categories: positive or negative. The input data is a collection of tweets, and the model’s task is to predict the sentiment of each tweet based on its content. This is formulated as a binary classification problem, where the model learns to associate specific patterns in text (e.g., certain keywords or phrases) with positive or negative sentiment. The classification model will be trained using a labeled dataset and will rely on text features extracted from the tweets. To evaluate the model's performance, various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, will be used to measure its effectiveness in distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments.

# METHODOLOGY

To tackle the problem of tweet sentiment classification, the proposed solution involves the following steps:
1.	Data Collection:
o	Tweets are collected using the Twitter API. Keywords, hashtags, or specific user handles can be used to gather relevant tweets. For this project, a dataset of labeled tweets (where the sentiment is already tagged as positive or negative) will be used for training and evaluation.
o	For real-time analysis, the system can be adapted to stream tweets using the Twitter API, enabling continuous sentiment analysis on live data.
2.	Data Preprocessing:
o	Cleaning: Raw tweets often contain noise, such as URLs, special characters, mentions (e.g., @user), and hashtags. These need to be removed or processed appropriately before analysis.
o	Tokenization: Tweets are broken down into individual tokens (words or phrases), which form the basis for further analysis.
o	Lowercasing: To reduce the dimensionality and treat words in any case (e.g., "Happy" and "happy") as the same, all text is converted to lowercase.
o	Stopword Removal: Common words like "the," "is," and "in" do not contribute much to sentiment and are removed from the text.
o	Lemmatization: Words are reduced to their base or root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run"), ensuring consistency across different word forms.
3.	Feature Extraction:
o	Bag of Words (BoW): The text is represented as a collection of words and their frequencies, which forms a feature vector for each tweet.
o	TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): This method weights words based on their frequency in a tweet relative to their frequency in the entire corpus, emphasizing more important words.
o	Sentiment Lexicons: Predefined dictionaries containing words that are associated with positive or negative sentiment can be used as features to enhance classification accuracy.
o	N-grams: Sequences of n words (bigrams, trigrams) can be considered to capture context and meaning beyond individual words.
4.	Model Training:
o	Logistic Regression: A simple and interpretable machine learning algorithm is used for binary classification. Logistic regression is particularly well-suited for problems where the output is categorical (in this case, positive or negative sentiment). The algorithm is trained on the preprocessed tweet data and uses the extracted features to classify new, unseen tweets.
o	Cross-Validation: To avoid overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well to new data, cross-validation is employed. This involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets and training the model on different subsets while testing on the remaining data.
5.	Model Evaluation:
o	Accuracy: This is the proportion of correctly classified tweets out of all predictions made.
o	Precision: The proportion of true positives out of all tweets predicted as positive.
o	Recall: The proportion of true positives out of all actual positive tweets.
o	F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a balanced measure of the model’s performance, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
6. Deployment:
•	After training and evaluation, the model is deployed to classify tweets in real-time or batch mode. It can be integrated into a web application or social media monitoring tool to track sentiments over time.
